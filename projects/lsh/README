Xenofarm project lsh
====================

LSH is a free implementation of the Secure Shell (ssh) protocol. It
includes a server, a client, and several utility programs. More
information can be found at http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/lsh.

It is written in C, with some source files automatically generated
from scheme-like expressions. You don't need any Scheme interpreter to
build it, though, an ANSI-C compiler is enough.

There's only one xenofarm configuration to test. It takes
approximately 10 minutes to build and test on a Pentium III.


Dependencies
============

To be able to build LSH, you first need to install

  GMP,         http://www.swox.se/gmp
  liboop,      http://www.liboop.org
  GNU make     http://www.gnu.org/software/make
							   
It is also recommended that you install tcputils,
ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/tcputils, which is needed for the
proper testing of the lsh port forwarding features.
