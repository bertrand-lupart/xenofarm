Xenofarm project Pike (Pikefarm)

Pike is a very portable and highly optimized general purpose, just in
time compiled programming language that looks like C, C# and Java.
More information about the programming language Pike can be found on
its web pages at http://pike.lysator.liu.se/

The Xenofarm project Pike takes about 20 minutes to perform the
standard test on an average modern computer (2Ghz, 2GB), but some
of the special tests, like dmalloc or valgrind, can take considerably
more time (and memory). Normally the Pikefarm server creates new packages
no more often than every second hour. The build results can be seen at
http://pike.lysator.liu.se/development/pikefarm/

The configuration file pike.cfg contains several different test
targets. Comment out the tests you don't want to run, "decomment" the
ones that you do want to run and copy or symlink the file to your
Xenofarm clients config directory.

Description of the targets:
default:  Compiled and tested as any user would do it.
dmalloc:  Compiled and tested with debug malloc to look for memory
          leaks. This target takes more resources in time and memory
          than the default target.
feature:  Compiled with extra/experimental features like security
          sandbox and new optimizations. This target is normally
          about as resource consuming as the default target.
thorough: dmalloc+feature
static:   Compiled with static modules. This test is not very
          interesting on architectures that aren't Microsoft Windows.
