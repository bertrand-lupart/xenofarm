Building ArgoUML with Xenofarm

ArgoUML is an UML design tool with cognitive support built entirely in Java.
It is also an Open Source project located at Tigris distributed with the 
BSD License. See http://argouml.tigris.org/ for details.

The Xenofarm project provides ArgoUML with help in building and
running through the JUnit test cases. The task "package" builds the
whole of ArgoUML. The task "tests" runs all the JUnit test cases.

The configuration file argouml.cfg contains one test for each jdk 
version that you want to run. You can run as many as you have the
corresponding jdk installed. Each one should take less than an hour
to run. The JDK1.2 (target called java12) is rather pointless though
since it is not maintained.

The result of the xenofarm builds are currently presented at
