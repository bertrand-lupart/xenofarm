1. This is the Xenofarm client.

You need to install this software on each machine you intend to attach
to the Xenofarm as a compile and test client. To ensure that it is as
easy as possible to set up on new and strange OSes the main part if
the client in written in pure Posix sh, calling a few external
binaries to handle the network communication with the Xenofarm master.


2. Compiling "put".

FIXME.


3. Other requirements.

FIXME: wget et all.


4. Configuring the client.

client.sh is configured by editing the projects.conf file. Each
project should have seven lines on the form:

Projectname
Build directory
URL to fetch the snapshot from
URL to PUT the result too.
The names of the targets that should be built.
The minimum time between two builds of the project
end Projectname

repeat for each project that should be built.


5.  Starting the client.

FIXME: cron.
