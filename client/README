1. This is the Xenofarm client.

You need to install this software on each machine you intend to attach
to the Xenofarm as a compile and test client. To ensure that it is as
easy as possible to set up on new and strange OSes the main part if
the client in written in pure Posix sh, calling a few external
binaries to handle the network communication with the Xenofarm master.


2. Compiling "put".

FIXME.


3. Other requirements.

FIXME: wget et all.


4. Configuring the client.

FIXME: See the example file "projects.conf" for now.


5.  Starting the client.

FIXME: cron.
