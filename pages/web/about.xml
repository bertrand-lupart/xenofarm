<h2>This is Xenofarm</h2>

<p>
The Xenofarm project is a rather small project, if measured in code.
This is because the wonders of modern computer engineering lets us
reuse components to build advanced applications with ease, letting us
programmers focus on important tasks as design and quality. Did you
buy that? Well, normally the world isn't as perfect as we like it to
be, but in this case it is, since Xenofarm is just some glue
components holding together other components.
</p>

<p>
The goal of Xenofarm is to aid programmers who want to build extremely
platform independent applications. Most programmers would say, "If I
want to do something platform independent I use
Pike/Python/Perl/Java/LOGO", but there are still some guys struggling
to get these programming languages to work on all strange OS on all
strange platforms. It is for them (us) this tool is built.
</p>

<p>
From a historical point of view, Xenofarm is a complete rewrite of the
automated build and regression test tool that was used by the Pike
programming language development team between 1999 and 2002. It was
called AutoBuild and was created by Martin Nilsson and Johan Schön at
Roxen Internet Software. AutoBuild was in turn derived from (or rather
inspired by) Tinderbox, a similar system used by the Mozilla
development team. Xenofarm still sticks to the basic AutoBuild
concept, but was redesigned to get rid of the few annoying flaws and
shortcomings of its predecessor. Most notably the system components
has been more loosly coupled and the system should scale to X
different clients performing Y different projects for Z different
servers.
