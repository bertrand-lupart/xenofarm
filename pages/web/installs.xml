<h2>Current installations</h2>

<p>Xenofarm is currently deployed in four different projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se/">Pike</a><br />
  Pike is a general purpose programming language and the longest user
  of Xenofarm, since Xenofarm was originally written for testing Pike.
  Result pages for Pikefarm can be found
  <a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se/development/pikefarm/">here</a>.
  <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="/lyskom/lyskom-server/">LysKOM Server</a><br />
  LysKOM is a communication system that combines the best aspects of ICQ
  and news into a system that more or less predates them both. Result
  pages for LysKOM can be found <a href="/lyskom/lyskom-server/xenofarm.html">here</a>.
  <br /><br /></li>
<li>Python</a><br />
  Python is another general purpose programming language that also
  uses Xenofarm, in a project they call <a href="/~sfarmer">Snake Farm</a>,
  to find portability problems. There are result pages
  both for <a href="/~sfarmer/xeno/latest.html">development python</a> and
  for the  <a href="/~sfarmer/xeno/latest-stable.html">stable python</a>.
  <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a><br />
  ArgoUML is a Java based modeling tool for UML distributed with the
  BSD License.
  It is able to create and save most of the nine standard UML diagrams.
  ArgoUML also has the ability to reverse engineer correct Java code and
  generate UML diagrams for it.
  See <a href="/xenofarm/argouml/result.html">the result page</a> for
  details on how the xenofarm builds are doing.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
