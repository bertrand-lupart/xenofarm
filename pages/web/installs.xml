<h2>Current installations</h2>

<p>Xenofarm is currently deployed in three different projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se/">Pike</a><br />
  Pike is a general purpose programming language and the longest user
  of Xenofarm, since Xenofarm was originally written for testing Pike.
  Result pages for Pikefarm can be found
  <a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se/development/pikefarm/">here</a>.
  <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="/lyskom/lyskom-server/">LysKOM Server</a><br />
  LysKOM is a communication system that combins the best aspects of ICQ
  and news into a system that more or less predates them both. Result
  pages for LysKOM can be found <a href="/lyskom/lyskom-server/xenofarm.html">here</a>.
  <br /><br /></li>
<li>Python</a><br />
  Python is another general purpose programming language that also
  uses Xenofarm to find portability problems. There are result pages
  both for <a href="python/">development python</a> and for the
  <a href="python-stable/">stable python</a>.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
